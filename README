General
=======

To learn more about ./waf, refer to http://code.google.com/p/waf/
and http://waf.googlecode.com/svn/docs/wafbook/single.html

Ideally, you will need only to add your source files in wscript, which is basically a Python program.

How to use skeleton
===================

Due to restrictions on lnxsrv, several steps necessary to compile and run (if you're using this skeleton):

1. The following lines should be added to your ~/.bashrc

export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u/cs/grad/yingdi/boost/lib:/usr/local/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

2. To configure environment

./waf configure

If there are any errors, please email me: iliamo@ucla.edu 
Please, mark your message with [CS118] header

3. To build/rebuild the code

./waf

4. All compiled executables are located in build/, so you can run them as this:

build/http-proxy
